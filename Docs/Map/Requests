To access the API, we need to use the WFS (Web Feature Service) protocol.
This protocol is used to request geographical features across the web using platform-independent calls.
The WFS protocol is based on the GML (Geography Markup Language) standard, which is an XML-based format for encoding geographical data:


using http://geo.irceline.be/wfs we can access the API to get all our necessary data.
    for example see the following link: http://geo.irceline.be/wfs?service=WFS&request=GetCapabilities


Request calls to get data from the WFS service. The following calls are supported:
- DescribeFeatureType
    To get detailed information about the water level data's structure (such as the names of the attributes)
- GetCapabilities
    To get information about the WFS service's capabilities
    -- Get necessary Data in a compatible format for python parsing - see example in get_features.py

... many more, I don't know yet
